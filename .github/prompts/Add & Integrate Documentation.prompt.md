I want to add this documentation/content file to the project.

Analyze & Rename: Read the content and suggest a descriptive filename (e.g., snake_case.md or kebab-case.html) that summarizes the topic.

Categorize: Suggest the most appropriate folder path (e.g., /docs, /public/articles) based on the project structure.

Link Updates: Identify which index files (like README.md, SUMMARY.md, or navigation configs) need to be updated to include a link to this new file, and provide the content to add.
